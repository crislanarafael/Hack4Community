          Create your free ReUp account. All we need is your name, username, and
          an email and you're good to go! <br /><br />
          To create and build our community,
          <em>users need to be registered to access the Exchange Area</em>,
          where you will begin your exchange with other useres, that is located
          on their dashboard. <br /><br />
          Be kind and respectful when creating your public posts. And most of
          all, don't be afraid to make some new friends on your upcycling
          journey!

          ReUp facilitates our user exchanges, though the rest is in your
          hands.<br /><br />
          You and your exchanger are responsible for agreeing on what clothing
          and/or textiles you plan on exchanging as well as determining
          transportation and meeting logistics.<br /><br />
          We encourage our users to connect with others based on location to
          further create those local community ties as well as our virtual ones,
          but we would love it if you decided to facilitate an international
          exchange. <br /><br />It is up to you!

        <p class="intro-paragraph">
          By making our exchange area public on your dashboards, we are
          promoting a social contract between ReUp users. Completing an exchange
          means you intend to creatively repurpose what was given to you.
          <br /><br />
          One feature we will implement in the near future is the ability for
          users to send digital "Thank You" tokens to each other. This can be
          shared on social media to show to your friends and families and
          reinforces our message that by participating with ReUp, you're doing a
          good job for yourself by gaining those skills in upcycling, and for
          your environment by preventing clothing and textiles to become
          landfill waste and reducing pollution created by producing more
          clothing and textiles than what's needed in our world!
