          <p class="intro-paragraph">
            Clothing and textiles are essential items for everyone. But they
            come at a price.
            <br /><br />
            The clothing and textile industry is considered one of the most
            polluted industries in the world. The production of clothing is
            resource-intensive and releases harmful pollutants into the water
            and air by way of chemicals used for dyeing and greenhouse gases
            emitted from factories and also by way of transporting the goods.
            Not to mention that these industries are susceptible to unfair labor
            practices.
            <br /><br />
            One way people can help reduce the impact of the industry is to
            reduce buying these items and instead recycle or upcycle what they
            have. Hence why we created ReUp.
            <br /><br />
            ReUp is an online hub where people can exchange unwanted clothing
            and textiles they have with others. We want to build our community
            around recycling and upcycling exchanged clothing and textile items
            so we've created digital "Thank You" tokens users can exchange with
            each other as a promise that the exchanged items will be put to good
            use.
            <br /><br />
            Our vision with ReUp is to build stronger community ties and nurture
            new skills and creativity that comes with reusing/upcycling among
            our users. All while they help us with our primary goal of reducing
            the environmental impact of the clothing and textile industry.
